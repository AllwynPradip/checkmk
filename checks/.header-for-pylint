# This mechanism was originally used to add "magic" imports and
# suppressions to make linters understand the checks/.
#
# Those imports have since been added to the checks/* files themselves.
#
# Without this hack, mypy currently complains about duplicate modules.
#
# NOTE:
# Renaming checks/{check,agent}_* files is an incompatible API change.
# We're planning a new 'proper' API one for those files anyway -
# I'd like to postpone the renaming of these files until then.
