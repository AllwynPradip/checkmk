This werk an issue with problem responses in two endpoints.

Endpoints affected
* activate_changes (GET)
* service_discovery (GET)

Previously, they would return a 404 with a title attribute only.  They now conform to
our other endpoints and return a problem response with status code, title and detail
attribute.
