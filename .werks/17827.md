No timeout has been set when downloading the agent output. As a result, it was possible that this process took an infinitely long time.

Now a timeout is set for the agent output download.
The following timeout settings are used:
- SNMP walks: 15 min
- Agent outputs: "Timeout for rescheduling checks in Multisite" setting (default = 10 sec)
