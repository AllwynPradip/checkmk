We recently added new features to the <i>extension packages</i> (a.k.a. <i>MKPs</i>) manager.

These changes require some adjustments and modernisations of the commandline interface to get a consistent user experience.

The following changes are made to the commandline interface <tt>mkp [COMMAND]</tt>:

<tt>find [--all] [--json]</tt>:
The find command now reports some details for each file.
If you are using the command in a script, we recommend setting the new <tt>--json</tt> flag, and pipe the output through the commandline tool "<tt>jq</tt>".
To get a list of all local files, for instance, use "<tt>mkp find --json --all | jq .[].file </tt>".

<tt>inspect PATH_TO_MKP_FILE</tt>:
This is a new command to show the contents of an MKP file as listed in its manifest file (a.k.a. "info").
The <tt>show</tt> and <tt>list</tt> commands no longer accept paths as argument.
