When new clock types were added to the MIB definition of Meinberg LANTIME time-servers, Checkmk was unable to determine from the ID whether it was a GPS or non-GPS clock and did not discover it as a service.

With this change, clocks will always be discovered as a service. 
If in doubt, it will be assumed that it is a non-GPS clock. 
The service state for unknown clock types will always be WARN or worse.
