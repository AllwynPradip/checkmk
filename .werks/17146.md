Checkmk used to come with an apache config file `etc/apache/conf.d/var_www.conf`.
By default this file added/enabled directory listing for sub-directories under `var/www/`.
The main folder `var/www` was not listed though since the URL is redirected to Checkmk.

In order to simplify the configuration we drop that file.

If you edited that file you will be asked if you want to keep it upon update.
If you relied on the directory listing you can enable it again e.g. by copying the file from an older version.
