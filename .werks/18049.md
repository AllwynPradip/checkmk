Previously the inventory archive files were handled by the diskspace cleanup
job and the history entries were handled by a separate housekeeping job.

Now the HW/SW Inventory has own cleanup parameters which can be configured below
`Setup > General > Global settings > Site management > Cleanup HW/SW Inventory files`.

These parameters can be configured per host or as a fallback:

 * Remove inventory files which are older than the configured file age

 * Keep the last X history entries

The default is set to `Keep the last 50 history entries`.

The cleanup job runs twice a day.
