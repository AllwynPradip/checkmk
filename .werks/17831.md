The newly introduced download timeout for SNMP devices requires the new global setting "SNMP walk download timeout".
This setting does not effect the fetching of SNMP data during regular or manually triggered checks.

This setting defaults the timeout on downloading SNMP walks via the UI to 15.0 minutes.
