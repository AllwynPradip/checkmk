### Problem
Previously, invalid regular expressions in file group patterns (in the fileinfo check) could be saved without warning.
This could lead to runtime errors.

### Fix
Patterns are now validated when editing the rule.
Only valid regular expressions can be saved.

### Impact
If your existing configuration contains invalid patterns, you will see an error message like:
```
The pattern <pattern> is not a valid regular expression: <error message>
```

You can either:

- Fix the broken patterns immediately as prompted, or
- Skip fixing and proceed with the update â€” your configuration will still work as before, but
editing those rules later will cause invalid patterns to be lost (the rule will be emptied).

### Action Required
Review and correct any problematic patterns before applying changes to the configuration.
