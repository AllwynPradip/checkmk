The plugin for monitoring Netscaler HA nodes has been reworked in multiple ways:

* The _HA Node Status_ service is not discovered anymore on appliances in standalone mode. Already
  discovered services will go stale and will disappear on re-discovery.

* The plugin will now report _UNKNOWN_ if the failover mode of the HA node is unknown. Before, the
  plugin reported _WARNING_ in this case.

* The plugin will now report _WARNING_ if the peer node reports that it is operating in standalone
  mode. Before, the plugin did not alert in this case.

* The plugin can now alert on failovers. This behavior is configurable. Users can choose to ignore
  failovers, which is the default, to compare against the failover mode at the point in time of the
  last service discovery or to expliclity configure the expected failover mode.
