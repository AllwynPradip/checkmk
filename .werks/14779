This removes some of the less useful graphs introduced in
Werks 14777 and 14778 from the OMD performance page.  The
corresponding metrics are still available over Livestatus.

The removed graphs are:  Number of performance data received;
Number of metrics received; Performance data loss for "connection";
Bytes sent to the "connection", where "connection" is either RRD,
InfluxDB or Carbon.
