With this Werk, the check_mail_loop monitoring check now includes the same information in both the email subject and body.
Previously the message body remained empty.

This change addresses two important issues:
 * Emails with empty bodies are often flagged as suspicious by email security solutions and may be blocked or quarantined
 * When emails are processed through SMS gateways that forward only the email body content as text messages, an empty body would break the mail loop monitoring

By duplicating the subject content in the message body, we gain compatibility with both email security systems and SMS gateway integrations while
preserving all existing functionality.
