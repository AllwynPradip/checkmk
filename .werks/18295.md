With this werk we are renaming a field in our REST API.

* Old field name: `mega_menu_icons`
* New field name: `main_menu_icons`

### What this means for you:
The old field name `mega_menu_icons` will still work temporarily, but it is now **deprecated**.
You should update all your scripts to use `main_menu_icons` instead of `mega_menu_icons`.

### Action required:
Please update any scripts that currently use `mega_menu_icons` to use `main_menu_icons` instead.
This change affects the user configuration REST API endpoints and the LDAP configuration endpoints.
