description:
 This check monitors the high-availability (HA) status of Citrix Netscaler
 load balancing appliances operating in a cluster setup. The check monitors
 the following aspects:

 - Health of the HA node.

 - Failover mode (primary/secondary) of the HA node. If the failover mode
   is unknown, the plugin goes UNKN. In case the appliance does not operate
   in HA mode anymore, the plugin goes stale. Furthermore, the plugin can
   alert on failovers. This behavior is configurable. Users can choose to
   ignore failovers, which is the default, to compare against the failover
   mode at the point in time of the last service discovery or to expliclity
   configure the expected failover mode.

 - Failover mode of the peer HA node. The plugin alerts if the failover mode
   of the peer node is unknown or if the peer node reports that it operates
   in standalone mode.

discovery:
 One service is created for each host that operates in high-availability mode.
