        UserIds are used in a variety of contexts, including HTML, file paths and other external
        systems. Currently we have no means of ensuring proper output encoding wherever UserIds
        are used. Thus, we strictly limit the characters that can be used in a UserId.

        Examples:

            The empty UserId is allowed for historical reasons (see `UserId.builtin`).

                >>> UserId.validate("")

            ASCII letters, digits, and selected special characters are allowed.

                >>> UserId.validate("cmkadmin")
                >>> UserId.validate("$cmk_@dmÃ¼n.1")

            Special characters other than '$_-@.' are not allowed (see `USER_ID_REGEX`).

                >>> UserId.validate("foo/../")
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
                ValueError: Invalid username: 'foo/../'

                >>> UserId.validate("%2F")
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
                ValueError: Invalid username: '%2F'

        initialization, so this method is not the only source for them.
        Moreover, be aware that it is very possible that some parts of the code use the UserId ""
